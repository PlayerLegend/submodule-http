/** @file http/client.h
    
    This file implements an http client capable of issuing GET requests. At the moment, only identity and chunked transfer encodings are supported.

    The intended workflow for this library is to first open a connection to a server using http_client_connect, then use the connection returned by that function to issue one or more get requests in series. Finally, after the last get request finishes or errors, use http_client_disconnect to destroy the connection and free all associated memory.
